# Face-Recognition

## 📌 Color‑Based Object Tracking with OpenCV
A simple Python program that tracks a colored object (e.g., red) from your webcam using OpenCV and prints basic movement directions (Left, Right, Front, Stop). It finds the largest contour of the chosen color and visualizes it in real‑time.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- OpenCV (opencv‑python)
- imutils

## 🚀 Features
✔️ Capture video from webcam
✔️ Mask a specific color range
✔️ Detect and track object
✔️ Draw circle and center on tracked object
✔️ Print simple direction guidance (Left/Right/Front/Stop)

## ▶️ How to Run

   pip install opencv-python imutils
- Run your script:
   python track.py
- Press q to quit.

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

This project helped me practice real‑time video processing, color‑based object detection, and basic movement logic using OpenCV.
